# madlibs-generator

The Mad Libs Generator gathers and manipulates user input data as an adjective, a pronoun, and a verb. The program takes this data and arranges it to build a story.


The end result is a simple, whimsical story that incorporates the words provided by the user. The specific content and humor of the story depend on the words the user enters. This script is a basic example of how to collect user input and use it to create dynamic text output in Python
